        <h2>Washington D.C. Music</h2>
        <p class="hometown">This night was dedicated to any music I could find from Washington DC. In the 1990's dischord records was formed
            by an unusual class of citizens.  They were the children of law makers and politicians. They were usually very vocal and very loud and desired
            to be heard by audiences that would be eager to hear them out as opposed to their parents who probably never listened to them at all.

                <h2>Vintage Computer Music</h2>
                <p>This night featured primitive computerized sequencers and synthesizers.  Ancient technology that took step by step inputting of numbers
                    to generate every click and beat.  I imagine it took a real long time to program music this way. I featured these artists: Kraftwerk, Einsturzende Neubauten,
                    SA 42, Front 242, Skinny Puppy.

        <h2>Music from the year 1988</h2>
        <p>This night featured a lot of the music of the year 1988. This was a great year in music. I was fortunate to be only a junior in High School and heard
                many fantastic new artists on my local radio station in New York, "WDRE."  They loved to play foriegn imports from the UK and Germany and even
                played some brand new material from revolutionary American artists.   We'd hear the release of The Pixies, Stone Roses, Nine Inch Nails, Jane's Addiction,
            and a lot of other bands that have now become staples within the annuls of music history.</p>

                    <h2>Yachts rock slowly.</h2>
                    <p>Here, the selections featured easy listening songs that might have been heard on a yacht in the 1970s-1980s on soft rock stations or
                        contemporary pop.  This style of music has been re-popularized recently by a group of nostalgic people longing for a taste of the past.
                    Featured artists were: Christopher Cross, Fleetwood Mac, The Eagles, Genesis.</p>
